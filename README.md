Sir, in the interview you said that you will check my GitHub and I want to tell you one thing I am new to GitHub. I completed all my projects in my 3rd year and then I came to know about the GitHub in 4th year before that I uploaded my files with upload option in GitHub. 
In the interview I forgot to tell you about this. And after that I don't know how to contact you regarding this problem. I hope you will read this and understand.
Thank you
